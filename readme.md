# FCEUX Standalone

A standalone, stripped-down version of FCEUX that loads a single 'game.nes' file from the working directory when run. Its purpose is to allow homebrew NES developers to ship games on platforms such as Steam.

This is a work in progress and will likely diverge significantly from TASVideos/fceux
