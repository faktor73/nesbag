# NESbag

https://www.eastpixel.de/nesbag

## WHAT'S THE SOURCE
It's a fork based on the original work of [Lowtek Games](http://lowtek.co.uk), named NESTEK.
Development work was carried out by [Kilgariff Technologies](https://kilgariff.tech) and commissioned by [Lowtek Games](http://lowtek.co.uk) as a useful tool for the NES homebrew community.

Forked from FCEUX (a very mature and accurate emulator), NESbag loads a single ROM (game.nes) from the same directory as the NESbag executable. It can also load a custom icon file (icon.ico) and a 256x224 splash image (splash.png).

## WHAT'S ABOUT
NESbag is a pun on NES and bagpack. It's like a backpack in the form of a Windows program into which you pack a self-developed NES game and then distribute this complete package as a stand-alone application.

The player only has to double-click on an .exe file to use it, just as he knows it.

It supports a developer-supplied config file with keymappings and allows the end user to change these mappings using its built-in menu (open it by press ESCAPE while the emulator is running).

## WHAT YOU GET
The NESbag.exe file, a sample splashscreen (splash.png) and a sample-configuration file.
